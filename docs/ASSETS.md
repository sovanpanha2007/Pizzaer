# Pizzaer — Free Assets

License words:
- **CC0** (public domain) — free to use for anything. No credit needed (but we credit anyway — it's nice).
- **Unity Companion License** — free to use in Unity projects.
- **Unity Asset Store EULA** (Standard license) — free to use in your game, but you may **not share the raw files publicly**. ⚠️ A public GitHub repo counts as sharing. Use these packs only if the repo is private.

**Our choice:** almost everything comes from **Kenney** (CC0). All Kenney packs share one style, so the town, food, cars, and people match. They also work in a public repo with no license problem.

**Rules:**
- Import **only the files you use** (not the whole zip). Keep each FBX together with its `Textures` folder.
- Put models in `Assets/_Pizzaer/Models/<PackName>/`, sprites in `Art/UI/`, and audio in `Audio/`.
- Every asset you add gets a line in the **Used assets log** at the bottom of this file.
